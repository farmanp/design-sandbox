# Design Sandbox

This project is a sandbox for experimenting with different frontend technologies and design patterns. It is intended as a playground for testing out new ideas and approaches to building user interfaces.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into different subdirectories, each of which contains a different experiment or prototype. These subdirectories are intended to be self-contained and modular, so that they can be easily reused or combined with other components in future projects.

One of these subdirectories is the "test-sandbox" folder, which contains a specific prototype or experiment. This folder is not intended to be a production-ready application, but rather a testing ground for trying out new tools and techniques.
